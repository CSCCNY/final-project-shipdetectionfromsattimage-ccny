Plan:

1. Find related papers and make a summary of the paper.

A) [FGSD: A DATASET FOR FINE-GRAINED SHIP DETECTION IN HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06832.pdf)

B) [Airbus Ship Detection - Traditional v.s. Convolutional Neural Network Approach](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/report/58.pdf)

C) [Satellite Image Classification with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06497.pdf)

1. Try to explore the datasets with EDA in notebook.
2. Share the analysis and make a decision.
3. Create a GitHub a repository.
4. Everyone should have their own branch.
5. We should create a folder to keep research paper notes.
6. Create one folder for data analysis.

Initial Goal:

1. Getting the data (4/14/2021)
2. Exploring the data (4/22/2021)
3. Apply Baseline analysis algo – SVM, RANDOM FOREST, Linear regression (4/29/2021)
4. Try to build the model – What are the hyperparameters are. (4/29/2021)
5. Image classifications, localization, object detection, segmentation, masking. (5/06/2021)
6. Do the comparative analysis. (05/10/2021)
7. Prepare the presentation. (05/12/2021)
8. Write the paper(05/18/2021)
